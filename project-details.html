                    <h2>3D Printing Overview</h2>
                    <p>WHAT IS 3D PRINTING?</p>
                    <span>3D printing uses computer-aided design to create three-dimensional objects through a layering
                        method. Sometimes referred to as additive manufacturing, 3D printing involves layering
                        materials, like plastics, composites or bio-materials to create objects that range in shape,
                        size, rigidity and color.</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>What Are 3D Printers?</p>
                    <span>In short, 3D printers use CAD to create 3D objects from a variety of materials, like molten
                        plastic or powders. 3D printers can come in a variety of shapes and sizes ranging from equipment
                        that can fit on a desk to large construction models used in the making of 3D-printed houses.
                        There are three main types of 3D printers and each uses a slightly different method.</span>

                    <p>TYPES OF 3D PRINTERS</p>
                    <span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stereolithographic, or SLA printers, are equipped with a laser that forms liquid resin
                                into plastic.</li>
                            <li>Selective laser sintering, or SLS printers, have a laser that sinters particles of
                                polymer powder into an already solid structure.</li>
                            <li>Fused deposition modeling, or FDM printers, are the most common. These printers release
                                thermoplastic filaments that are melted through a hot nozzle to form an object layer by
                                layer.</li>
                        </ul>
                        3D printers aren’t like those magical boxes in sci-fi shows. Rather, the printers — which act
                        somewhat similarly to traditional 2D inkjet printers — use a layering method to create the
                        desired object. They work from the ground up and pile on layer after layer until the object
                        looks exactly like it was envisioned.

                    <p>Advantages and Disadvantages of 3D Printing</p>
                    <br>
                    <span><b>Advantages of 3D Printing</b></span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span><b>3D Printers Are Affordable</b><br>
                        3D printing is capable of making the manufacturing process of complex parts more streamlined
                        thanks to software programming. This often means it is a more affordable option in some
                        industries.

                        Other factors that contribute to the affordability of 3D printing are the materials used. 3D
                        printing can utilize low-cost plastics and concrete that are easily accessible. Also, because
                        there is no need for a mold in 3D printing, that’s another cost taken off the table.</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span><b>3D Printers Are Fast</b><br>
                        3D printing is ideal for quick prototyping of products because it can be done in house in small
                        runs. This allows manufacturers to work out bugs and make changes to products faster than a
                        typical production process. Alterations to products can easily be made through CAD while the
                        manufacturing cost stays the same.</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span><b>3D Printers Can Work With Speciality Materials </b><br>
                        Despite plastics and metals being commonly used in the 3D printing industry, there are a host of
                        other options to choose from. The advantage means speciality parts and products can be made with
                        specific materials like water-absorbing plastic, nitinol, gold and carbon fiber. Speciality
                        materials like this allow for properties such as high heat resistance, water repellency and
                        strength.</span>

                    <br>

                    <span><b>Disadvantages of 3D Printing</b></span>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span><b>3D Printers May Not Provide Enough Strength</b><br>
                        A downside to building an object up layer by layer, is that this can affect the durability and
                        strength of the object. Of course, the strength of 3D printing relies heavily on what materials
                        are used; metals and concrete will always be some of the strongest materials used in 3D
                        printing. </span>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span><b>3D Printers May Have Accuracy Issues</b><br>
                        Although CAD is often an accessible and accurate way to design, there can be errors. Accuracy
                        with 3D printing is dependent on the techniques and printers use. For example, some smaller 3D
                        printers, like desktop models, can wear out easily. This means that as the production of a
                        design goes on, the products made later on may vary from the first batch. </span>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span><b>3D Printers May Require Post-Processing </b><br>
                        Another pitfall of 3D printing is the work required to finish up a product. This might include
                        sanding or smoothing out an object, heat treatment or removing support struts. Post-processing
                        of 3D printed products can sometimes lead to additional costs. </span>

                    <span>Once the STL file ready, it is sliced in Slicer or in Cura or may be in any other slicing
                        software. Slicing is the process of conversion of the STL file to .gcode format. This includes
                        the process of deciding the nozzle movements in space in order to make the design. Several
                        settings are made in this section of the print by engineers in order to achieve the best quality
                        print. Each printer has its own slicer settings. Everything, starting from the melting
                        temperature of the PLA material to setting of the bed temperature is done here. The layer width
                        is the most crucial portion of any 3d print Sets of data are prepared and print quality is
                        judged.</span>

                            <h2>Melin Codes</h2>
                            <p>WHAT ARE MERLIN CODES?</p>
                            <br>
                            <span>Marlin G-code is a type of firmware used by several respected 3D printer brands,
                                including Creality, Prusa, LulzBot, and Ultimaker. <br>

                                Its role is to act as a communicator between the slicer software and the printer,
                                helping transform an STL file into an actual physical object. <br>

                                While most 3D printers use Marlin G-code, the slicers typically generate G-codes
                                automatically with no input required from users. <br>

                                When starting the printing process, the printer’s computer reads the commands received
                                via G-code after slicing, moving the printer’s arm, and adjusting extrusion accordingly.
                                <br>

                                This automated process makes it easy for everyone to 3D print, regardless of the
                                individual’s programming skills. Yet, understanding G-code basics and commands can help
                                you unlock the next level of 3D printing. </span>

                            <br>

                            <p>HOW MERLIN WORKS?</p>
                            <span>Marlin is a derivative of G-code whose role is to manage all activities of the printer
                                in real time. <br>

                                It runs on the printer’s main board and coordinates the machine’s heaters, buttons,
                                sensors, lights, steppers, and all other components involved in the 3D printing process.
                                <br>

                                It also communicates commands from the slicer to the printer, implementing the additive
                                manufacturing process called fused deposition modeling (FDM). <br>

                                FDM basically refers to the process through which the printer’s motor pushes filament
                                through a nozzle moved under computer control. <br><br>

                                <b>In a simplified version, this is how Marlin works: </b> <br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A slicer software reads the STL file prepared with a CAD program. </li>
                                    <li>The slicer prepares a solid 3D model from the STL file and slices it into thin
                                        layers. In the process, it generates the G-code that tells the printer how to
                                        reproduce that model. </li>
                                    <li>The sliced file is then transferred to a host, which can be a customized version
                                        of Cura or Repetier installed on the 3D printer board or another host, such as a
                                        desktop system, Raspberry Pi, or Android device. The host controls Marlin during
                                        printing. </li>
                                </ul>
                                Learning the various commands and functions of G-codes can help you edit the file and
                                even make changes to the model without going through all of the steps above.
